## 6. Introduction 🎯📈

Forecasting student academic outcomes represents a crucial endeavor within educational data science, particularly in the context of improving institutional efficiency and reducing attrition rates. Traditional mechanisms for academic evaluation are reactive rather than proactive. This research adopts a data-driven, predictive modeling approach grounded in machine learning to construct an early warning system capable of identifying students who are likely to underperform, thereby enabling timely pedagogical interventions. 🚦

## 7. Objective 🎓🎯

To architect and implement a machine learning-based predictive framework capable of discerning academic performance outcomes in students, thereby facilitating evidence-based decision-making within academic support structures. 🏆

## 8. Problem Statement ❗🤔

There exists a deficit of intelligent systems that leverage historical academic and demographic data to proactively detect students at risk of academic failure. This project seeks to address the absence of a robust, data-centric methodology for early detection and support intervention in academic contexts. 🛑
