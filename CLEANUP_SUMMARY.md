# Academic Risk Predictor - Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted

The following unnecessary/redundant files have been removed from the project:

1. **PROJECT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Documentation of previous cleanup work
2. **COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of previous completion work
3. **FINAL_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Documentation of final project structure from previous work
4. **PROJECT_INFORMATION.md** - Redundant technical documentation (information already in README.md)

## Rationale for Deletion

1. **PROJECT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md**, **COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md**, and **FINAL_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**:
   - These files were created during a previous cleanup effort and are no longer needed
   - Their information has been incorporated into the main README.md file
   - They add no functional value to the project

2. **PROJECT_INFORMATION.md**:
   - Contains redundant information already present in README.md
   - Maintaining multiple documentation files with similar content creates confusion
   - README.md is the standard location for project documentation

## Current Project Structure

The project now has a clean, minimal structure with only essential files:

```
├── .gitignore                  # Git ignore file
├── ML_Project_Report.txt       # Academic project report
├── README.md                   # Main project documentation
├── app.py                      # Main Streamlit web application
├── generate_model.py           # Script to generate model from sample data
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── retrain_and_save_model.py   # Script for model retraining
├── setup.py                    # Setup script for easy installation
├── student_success_data.csv    # Sample dataset
├── student_df.pkl              # Pickled DataFrame
├── student_pipe.pkl            # Trained model pipeline
├── verify_setup.py             # Script to verify project setup
```

## Verification

The project has been verified to ensure all functionality remains intact:
- ✅ All required files are present
- ✅ All dependencies can be imported
- ✅ Data loads successfully
- ✅ Model loads successfully

The application is ready to run with `streamlit run app.py`
