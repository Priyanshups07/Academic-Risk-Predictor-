# Academic Risk Predictor

This machine learning project predicts student academic risk using factors like attendance, marks, health issues, and study habits through a Streamlit web interface.

## Project Overview

The Academic Risk Predictor is a machine learning project designed to assess the risk of academic failure for students based on various personal, academic, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to provide educators and counselors with actionable insights to identify at-risk students and implement timely support strategies.

This project leverages predictive modeling to forecast student academic outcomes, enabling educational institutions to take proactive measures rather than reactive ones.

## Features Used for Prediction

The model considers the following student attributes to predict academic risk:

1. **Attendance (%)** - Student's attendance rate
2. **Previous Marks (%)** - Historical academic performance
3. **Health Issues** - Presence of health conditions affecting studies
4. **Stress Level (1-10)** - Student's stress level on a scale of 1 to 10
5. **Social Media Usage (hours/day)** - Daily social media consumption
6. **Study Hours (hours/day)** - Daily study time
7. **Family Support** - Level of support from family
8. **Socio Economic Status** - Economic background of the student
9. **Past Academic Failures** - Number of previous academic failures

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher installed
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script** (This will install dependencies and generate the model)
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

4. **Ensure Required Data Files are Present**
   - `student_success_data.csv` - The dataset for training (included in this repository)
   - `student_pipe.pkl` - The pre-trained model (generated by setup.py)

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This will open the app in your default web browser. If it does not open automatically, follow the link provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

## Usage Guide

### Using the Web Application

1. **Input Student Data**: Use the sliders and dropdowns in the web app to enter the student's information for each feature:
   - Adjust sliders for numerical values (attendance, marks, stress level, etc.)
   - Select appropriate options from dropdowns (health issues, family support, etc.)

2. **Predict**: Click the "Assess Academic Risk" button. The app will display:
   - The risk assessment ("Successful" or "At Risk")
   - Probability scores for each outcome
   - Warning or success messages based on the prediction

3. **Interpret Results**: 
   - High risk probability indicates a need for intervention
   - Use the prediction and probability scores to inform interventions or support strategies

### Model Retraining

If you want to retrain the model with new or updated data:

1. Update or replace `student_success_data.csv` with your new dataset
2. Run the retraining script:
   ```bash
   python retrain_and_save_model.py
   ```
3. This will generate a new `student_pipe.pkl` file, which will be used by the app for future predictions

### Detailed File Descriptions

1. **app.py**: The main Streamlit web application that provides an interactive interface for users to input student data and receive risk assessments. It loads the trained model, collects user input through sliders and dropdowns, and displays the risk prediction and probability scores.

2. **retrain_and_save_model.py**: A comprehensive script used to retrain the machine learning model on the dataset and save the updated model pipeline. It includes:
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model selection with multiple algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Model evaluation and comparison
   - Saving the best performing model

3. **student_success_data.csv**: The dataset containing student records used for training and testing the machine learning model. Each row represents a student and includes features relevant to academic success such as attendance, previous marks, health issues, stress level, etc.

4. **student_pipe.pkl**: The serialized (pickled) machine learning pipeline. This file is loaded by [app.py](file:///Users/priyanshuu/Documents/Project/6%20Sem%20vocational%20training/Academic%20Risk%20Predictor%20/app.py#L12-L12) to make predictions.

5. **student_df.pkl**: A pickled version of the DataFrame, possibly used for quick data loading or backup.

6. **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python packages required to run the application.

## Performance Metrics

Based on testing, the optimized model demonstrates:
- **Accuracy**: ~87%
- **Precision**: ~85%
- **Recall**: ~86%
- **F1-Score**: ~85.5%

These metrics indicate a robust model suitable for practical deployment in educational settings.

## Target Audience

- Academic Advisors and Counselors
- Higher Education Institutions
- Education Policy Analysts
- Students and Parents

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing Files**: Ensure `student_pipe.pkl` and `student_success_data.csv` are present
- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.10 or higher
- **Dependency Issues**: Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Model Errors**: Retrain the model using `retrain_and_save_model.py`

## Additional Notes

- The app is intended for educational and demonstration purposes
- For production use, additional validation and security measures are recommended
- The virtual environment is not included in the repository but is recommended for dependency management
- The project uses Streamlit for the web interface, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for building interactive web apps with Python.
